      <h3>Honours Thesis</h3>
      <p>Computational Modelling of the effects of Oriented External Electric Fields on Glycine</p>
      <!-- Expand/ collapse button -->
      <button class="toggle-btn">View More Details</button>
      <!-- Hidden Content -->
      <div class="hidden-content">
        <p>The project focused on simulating the behavior of glycine molecules under varying external electric fields. Key highlights include:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Developed a three-dimensional model to map glycine's potential energy surface by varying dihedral angles, forming the foundation for advanced predictive modeling.</li>
	  <li>Investigated and applied modified Shepard interpolation methods, leveraging first and second-order derivatives to enhance predictive accuracy and enable model extrapolation.</li>
	  <li>Created and implemented rotation matrices for precise data transformation and molecular orientation in computational simulations.</li>
	  <li>Modeled glycine's interactions under varying electric fields (x, y, z) to characterize enzyme binding and structural changes, leveraging computational data analysis techniques.</li>
	  <li>Engineered the first full-dimensional (24-dimensional) data model for a molecule larger than three atoms, showcasing innovation in high-dimensional modeling.</li>
	  <li>Validated the model by accurately predicting glycine's behavior in biologically relevant environments, such as water, as seen in the gif below.</li>
	  <li>Check this file out <a href="theory_methods_marked.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to view the methods used to create these predictive models.</li>
